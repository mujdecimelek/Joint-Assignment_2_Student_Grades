<h2>Model Training</h2>
<p>A linear regression model is trained using the preprocessed data. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set.</p>

<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
<p>The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> Measures the average magnitude of the errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> Measures the average of the squares of the errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</strong> The square root of the average of squared differences.</li>
    <li><strong>R² Score:</strong> Represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance Metrics:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> 4.353454844747764e-15</li>
    <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> 3.4873374317853227e-29</li>
    <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</strong> 5.905368262678732e-15</li>
    <li><strong>R² Score:</strong> 1.0</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation and Commentary</h2>
<p>The model shows almost perfect performance metrics with an R² score of 1.0 and error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) close to zero. This indicates that the model's predictions almost perfectly match the actual values.</p>
<p>These results can usually occur due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Model Overfitting:</strong> The model has fit the training data excessively well and is predicting the test data perfectly. In this case, the model may not generalize well to real-world data.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Structure Issue:</strong> There might be an extremely obvious relationship between the independent and dependent variables in the dataset, or there might be an error in the data.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Accuracy:</strong> The model genuinely performs exceptionally well on the training and test data.</li>
</ol>

<h2>R² Score and Error Metrics:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Being close to 0 indicates that the model's predictions are very accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> Measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and what is estimated. Being close to 0 indicates that the model is not making large errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</strong> The square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation. Being close to 0 indicates that the errors are small and the model performs well.</li>
    <li><strong>R² Score:</strong> A statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. An R² score of 1.0 indicates that the model explains all the variance and fits perfectly.</li>
</ul>
